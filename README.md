# Allergic Events Detection using Deep Learning



## Introduction

This is the code of our hierarchal attention neural network to automatically identify allergic events from hospital safety reports.

This code was deeply integrated with the protected clinical data, so we currently only release the core implementation of our model. We are working on decoupling this code and will release a clean and easy-to-access version in the future.


## Requirement

	Python: 3.7  
	PyTorch: 1.0 



## Update

* 2020-02-19: core implementation
