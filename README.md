# Allergic Events Detection using Deep Learning



## Introduction

This is the code of our hierarchal attention neural network to automatically identify allergic events from hospital safety reports.

This code was deeply integrated with the protected clinical data, so this is the core implementation of our model. 


## Requirement

	Python: 3.7  
	PyTorch: 1.0
